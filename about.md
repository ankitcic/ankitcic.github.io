<p> Hello, My name is Ankit. I'm a Senior (4th Year) Student at Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology and Mathematical Innovations with Minors in Management. 

I love exploring and learning about new interesting things. My motto being "It's important to learn and not repeat the same mistakes. What's done is done." -MS Dhoni. 

Apart from Academics, I enjoy spending time playing (and learning to play) online games.</p>
